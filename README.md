## Abstract 

According to WHO, acute gastroenteritis is the second leading cause of death for children in the world. This scenario is more serious in developing countries. It is assumed that the vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths from acute gastroenteritis are caused by rotavirus. In 2009, WHO recommended the international vaccination of children aged 0-5 due to the success of vaccination campaigns in countries that adopted this public policy. 

Currently, there are a variety of rotavirus vaccines, making the cost-benefit assessment of these vaccines desirable. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to these cost-benefit assessments. For that, a broad approach was adopted with emphasis on the quantitative analysis of the dynamics of the disease. The method consisted of adopting a simple compartmental model of reference of the international literature on disease modelling, which contained codes for numerical simulation for this model. 

This reference model was studied, simulated for different values to later assign the parameters of the model to the estimated values for rotavirus in the State of São Paulo. The results were compared with the data obtained from the data from the Datasus for the disease and with other models of the literature. There was no verification of the adequacy of this model, which was initially more general, and new developments for the modelling of rotavirus in the State of São Paulo are required.

Keywords: Rotavirus, epidemic modelling, vaccination protocols.

## The Kermack–McKendrick Model

* SIR describes a disease which confers immunity against re-infection, to indicate that the passage of individuals is from the susceptible class S to the infective class I to the removed class R. 

* SIS describes a disease with no immunity against re-infection, to indicate that the passage of individuals is from the susceptible class to the infective class and then back to the susceptible class.

* Other possibilities include SEIR and SEIS models, with an exposed period between being infected and becoming infective, and SIRS models, with temporary immunity on recovery from infection.
